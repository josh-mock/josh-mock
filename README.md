# Hi there, I'm Josh 👋

I'm a **Full-Stack Web Developer** with a strong interest in **data-driven applications**. I love building scalable web apps that **solve real-world problems** and turn complex data into **meaningful insights**.

## 🚀 About Me

I graduated with a **BA in Arabic and Persian** and currently work in disputes and investigations, where attention to detail and analytical thinking are key.

After discovering a love for problem-solving, I taught myself **Python** through **Harvard's CS50** and recently completed the **full-stack web development program** at [The Jump Digital School](https://www.thejump.tech/).

I'm now looking to launch my career in tech, where I can combine my curiosity, technical skills, and drive to build tools that solve real problems.
